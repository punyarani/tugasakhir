### Background
Identifying fatigue is essential to prevent injuries from physical activity. This research analyzes EMG signal behavior in the quadriceps muscle during running. It evaluates fatigue using physiological indices, considering changes in EMG activation frequency, amplitude, and %HRR. The aim is to guide personalized fitness after treadmill running with specific intensities, enhancing performance and preventing bodily harm.

### Method
